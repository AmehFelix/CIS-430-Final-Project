# CIS-430-Final-Project
The Notebook was created using colab, I would highly recommend viewing that as it has a lot of the comments as well as the conclusion section in there. 
I found out pretty late that there's a template and on there  you specified GitHub, so I haven't really had time to do much apart from paste the notebook here.
As for actual README info, the libraries and necessary packages are all specified in the notebook but I will also paste them here:

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.cm as cm
import numpy as np


from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering
import scipy.cluster.hierarchy as shc
import seaborn as sns
